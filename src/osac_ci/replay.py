"""Replay: does the planner agree with what actually happened to recently merged PRs?

This is the evidence for the parity gate (design decision D7). For every PR merged in the window the planner reads
the PR's final state and must say it was ready to merge. Any other verdict is a DISAGREEMENT. A disagreement is
either explained (listed with a reason in an explained-ledger that the infra group signs off) or unexplained;
only unexplained ones fail the gate.

Two modes. ``final`` (the default) reads the PR's final state, labels and checks as they are now: it proves the
planner never calls a legitimately merged PR blocked on today's data, but not that it would have let the PR in when
the decision was made. ``enqueue`` rebuilds each PR as it stood when it was enqueued (or merged, for a direct merge)
from the timestamps on labels, reviews and check runs (see ``timeline.py``). There, a queue-merged PR agrees when
today's enqueue rule held at that moment (the labels or approval, no draft), because that is the rule the system
actually applied: it never reads check results. The full verdict is reported next to it, so the report also shows what
the planner would have held back that today's flow let in.
