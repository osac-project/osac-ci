"""Compare: on every open PR, does "OSAC CI says ready" match "every required check passes"?

This is the evidence for the trial stage. Today the merge rules require a fixed list of checks (the repository's
branch ruleset). OSAC CI computes its own answer from the policy. Before anyone relies on that answer, the two have to
agree on the PRs people actually open, and every difference has to have a reason. Both answers are computed from the
same snapshot of the PR, so a difference is never a timing artefact.

Four outcomes per PR:

- ``agree-ready`` and ``agree-blocked``: nothing to explain.
- ``looser``: OSAC CI says ready while a required check has not passed. This is the unsafe direction: if OSAC CI
  replaced the list, this PR would get in. Each one is listed with the required checks that stand in the way.
- ``stricter``: every required check passed while OSAC CI holds the PR back. The reason is OSAC CI's own verdict (an
  approval, an authorization, an E2E signal, a lock). Safe, but it would block a PR that merges today.

Separately it compares the list itself: checks the ruleset requires that the policy does not know (OSAC CI would not
wait for them) and the other way round.

Read-only. A PR that cannot be read becomes its own row; it never aborts the run.
